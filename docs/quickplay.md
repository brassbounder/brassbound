# Quick Play Rules
## Objective
Earn the most Victory Points by the end of 6 rounds.
## Ruler and Dice
All measurements are done in units of the long side of one 2x4 building brick. Distances in the game are grouped into one of four color-coded lengths:
- Short <span class=short>(S)</span> - up to 2 bricks
- Medium <span class=med>(M)</span> - up to 4 bricks
- Long <span class=long>(L)</span> - up to 8 bricks
- Table <span class=table>(T)</span> - no distance limit
## Setup
The playing area is a rectangle sized 24x16 bricks ( 30”x20”). Each player picks one short edge of the board and places one of each of the 3 units below within <span class=med>(M)</span> of their edge. Place 3 Strategic Points in the middle of the playing area, <span class=short>(S)</span> away from anything else.
## Cover and Terrain
Cover is any object at least as tall and wide as a building brick. Use 6+ pieces of cover. Terrain is a characteristic of the battlefield that affects how units move and activate. In these rules, there are only two kinds of terrain:
- **Standard terrain** - no effect
- **Impassable Terrain** - blocks movement.
## 6 rounds in a game
Take turns activating one unit at a time, until all units have activated. The younger player goes first in rounds 1, 2 and 3. The older player goes first in rounds 2, 4 and 6.
## Quality Checks
Whenever a squad with one or more wounded soldiers activates, roll one d6 for each wounded model:
- If the result is less than or equal to the number of unwounded models, the model survives. Put it back on the base.
- Otherwise the wounded model dies and is removed from the game.
## Activating Units
A unit can move or shoot, in any order. It can also decline to move or shoot at all.
**Move**  
First turn the unit to face the desired direction. Next put a ruler next to the front of the unit and move the unit forward so that the front has moved up to the Move Range below. A unit cannot end a move on top of another unit or piece of cover.
**Shoot**  
Each unit has a number and type of dice to use when shooting, called the dice pool. These conditions must be met in order to attack:
- The unit must have a weapon in range. Measure the closest point between the unit and the target using the ruler. You may only attack with a weapon that has a
Shoot range greater than or equal to that distance.
- Use the ruler to make a straight line between the middle of the attacking unit and the middle of the target. If a line cannot be done without cross through
cover or another model, the attack is canceled.  
If both conditions are met, roll the dice pool.
## Defending
If part of the target is behind cover, the attacker adds one dice of the same type to the dice pool. After rolling, the defender removes one dice from the result.
**If the target is a Squad…**  
Squads take hits on dice rolls of **4 or less (4-)**. For each hit, remove one model from the base and place it next to the unit, to show it is wounded. If all of the models are wounded, the unit is destroyed. Otherwise, the next time the squad activates, it must pass a **Quality Check** to see if the model lives or dies.
**If the target is a Vehicle…**  
Vehicles take hits on a dice roll of **5 or more (5+)**. Save the dice that scored hits and discard the remainder. For each hit, reroll that dice and compare the new result to the Armor column in the stat table below for the target. If the dice result is greater, place a damage token on the vehicle. Otherwise, the hit
bounces off the armor. If ever the vehicle receives a second damage token, it is destroyed.
## Scoring
At the end of the round, when all units have activated or passed, the player with the most units within <span class=short>(S)</span> of each Strategic Point controls it. If there is a tie, the player with the most Squads within <span class=short>(S)</span> controls that Strategic Point. Award 1 Victory Point for each Strategic Point each player controls. The Player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins!
